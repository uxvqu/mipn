As understood, a project involves a collective effort, with each member potentially configuring distinct features for the code. A version control system serves as a valuable tool for developers to systematically monitor all modifications made to the source code. Alongside managing changes, it meticulously records the authorship of alterations, providing transparency on who made what changes and when.\n",
    "\n",
    "### ***Version Management***\n",
    "Concluding a project with one version is impossible! A version control system facilitates the organization of multiple iterations of a project, maintaining order in the source code. It permits the establishment of ***a new branch for every developer implementing alterations in the code***, ensure that these changes are vetted (reviewed and approved) by other developers before being merged into the original code.\n",
    "\n",
    "Upon obtaining approval from fellow contributors, the new code seamlessly integrates with the main source, becoming the latest project version. This approach enables individuals to work on a duplicate of the project, allowing them to make edits without impacting the efforts of others. ***They can commit changes when the task is completed***. Consequently, it amplifies productivity, augments team efficiency, and minimizes the potential for errors and conflicts."
